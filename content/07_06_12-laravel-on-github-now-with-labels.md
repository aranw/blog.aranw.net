title: Laravel on Github, now with labels!

I have just finished adding labels to the Laravel github repository, along with labeling existing issues to add more clarity to the type of issue they represent. Hopefully this will allow for better user contributions, and allow Taylor to skim over the issues relevant to him, which should lead in more frequent updates. Here's an explanation for both contributors to the project and Core members.

---more---

<strong>Bug</strong>

This label contains issues that have been reported as bugs, or errors in the code. They may not have been confirmed as a bug by a team member yet. This is a great place to start if you are looking to contribute to the framework with a fix.

<strong>Feature - Pending</strong>

These are features that have been proposed by users of the frameworks, please +1 any feature which you think may be of use to you.

<strong>Feature - Confirmed</strong>

Confirmed feature proposals, due to be implemented in the near future.

<strong>Test - Queue</strong>

Shawn and Phill already came up with the great and sensible idea of having a testing branch, this label contains pull requests with code due to be tested to ensure that the feature/fix they provide work, and doesn't conflict with the core.

<strong>Test - Working</strong>

This label is where tests in the queue that have been confirmed working will place, it's a great one for Taylor / Core members to browse to easily merge + close some issues.

<strong>Test - Broken</strong>

These are failed pull requests, and will require more action from the author.

Hopefully the addition of these labels will make it easier for you to see what's happening with Laravel, and will hopefully inspire some contributions to the project!
