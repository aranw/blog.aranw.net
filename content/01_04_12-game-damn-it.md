Dear Square<del datetime="2012-04-01T17:35:49+00:00">sof</del>-enix,

I have finally accepted that there will never be another good Final Fantasy game, I have accepted that you have whored out on making little social games or iPhone ports. So please don't rub it in my face, by using a logo-style that was once used by some of the best Japanese RPG games that ever graced the console world. It's teasing, and it's just plain not fair!

It kinda sucks that you hyped it with a big teaser trailer too, yeah well... ah forget it.
