I have thrown together a darker, bluer, and completely oranger theme over the last couple of days. Although it's not complete yet, you should find it in working order, you may find features being added as time passes.

For those interested, and quite frankly too nerdy, here are the details on the construction of the new theme.

The site has been written using <a title="HTML5" href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/Overview.html" target="_blank">HTML5</a>, built on top of the <a title="HTML5 Boilerplate Project" href="https://github.com/paulirish/html5-boilerplate" target="_blank">HTML5 Boilerplate by Paul Irish &amp; Contributors</a>. The boilerplate allows me to use the new standards' additional features, including improved semantic markup, without sacrificing older browsers. The site is also using a lot of CSS3 to render subtle animations and some shading where needed.

The CSS has been written in LESS format, and compiled on the fly using the fantastic <a title="LESS.js" href="http://lesscss.org" target="_blank">LESS.js</a>. CSS3 media queries allow for the site to be responsive, providing an equal reading experience for smaller screened devices. Don't believe me? Try it! Resize your browser down to what you would imagine a mobile phones browser size would be.

The <a title="Semantic Grid System" href="http://semantic.gs" target="_blank">semantic.gs</a> project has allowed me to align content in a consistent readable format, without compromising the clarity of the source code. The semantic grid works hand in hand with LESS.js to allow for column sizes and nesting to be specified in the CSS, without the need for adding extra classes to the HTML elements that make up the page.

The font used on the page is 'Proxima Nova' provided by <a title="TypeKit Fonts" href="http://typekit.com/" target="_blank">TypeKit</a>.

Of course everything else has been powered by the happy hackers at WordPress.

Hope you like it!
