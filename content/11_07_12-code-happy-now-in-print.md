After several months in the making I'm pleased to announce the print copy of Code Happy.

The print copy is<a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/dayle-rees/code-happy/paperback/product-20249496.html"> available from Lulu in A4 format</a>, with nicely sized type and code samples, and a beautiful glossy coa... cover. The book will later be published to Amazon, but please consider <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/dayle-rees/code-happy/paperback/product-20249496.html">buying it from Lulu</a> as they give their authors better royalties than nasty Amazon!

The paperback book is <a href="http://www.lulu.com/shop/dayle-rees/code-happy/paperback/product-20249496.html">priced at £24.99</a> and your payments will help a poor graduate pay off his student loans! (heres hoping!)

As always, the eBook is <a href="http://leanpub.com/codehappy">available on Leanpub in a number of formats</a> (pdf/epub/mobi) with a min price of $9.99.

If you haven't seen it yet, I also recommend checking out <a href="http://codehappy.daylerees.com/">the brand new Code Happy mini site</a> which has the majority of the book available to read on-line.

I hope you enjoy reading Code Happy, and I hope you enjoy using the Laravel framework!
