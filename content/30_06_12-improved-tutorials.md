Hey everyone!

Update: The <a title="Code Happy" href="http://codehappy.daylerees.com">new mini site is live, enjoy</a>!

---more---

You may have noticed that my tutorials on the blog have become outdated in comparison with the book. This is because Wordpress won't let me edit them without completely destroying the format of the code blocks. Now I don't want to hack the DB field to fix typos, and I don't want to spend hours redoing the formatting.

My solution? A new mini site for code happy that runs directly off the source for the book..
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-310" title="Code Happy _ Using Controllers" src="/img/code_happy_site.png" alt="" width="614" height="473" /></p>
<p style="text-align: left;">The mini site isn't completely done soon, but will follow shortly. I have tried to keep the design simple with a focus on readability, and trust me it is a pleasure to read.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">Hope you guys like it! Back to work for me, the site will be arriving shortly.</p>
