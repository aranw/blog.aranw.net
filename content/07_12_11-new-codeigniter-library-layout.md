After finally deciding to turn my method of nesting layouts into a CodeIgniter library, I am proud to release version 0.9 (beta) of 'Layout'.

---more---

Layout allows you to define your hierarchical layout structures within PHP arrays, to display complex HTML layouts. You can also bind data (just like with CI views) and attach assets to each view.

Full documentation, including a download link can be found at:

and the source for the library can be found on <a title="Layout on CodeIgniter" href="https://github.com/daylerees/layout">Github</a>, please feel free to contribute changes.

Let me know if the Library is of any use to you!
