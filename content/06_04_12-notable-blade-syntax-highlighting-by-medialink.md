I would simply like to bring to your attention the Blade language tm files created by Medalink from the Laravel community.

The tmfile can be used with Sublime Text 2, Textmate, or any other texteditor that supports the tmLanguage extension, to add syntax highlighting support for the Laravel Blade templating language, using colors from your current editors color scheme.

Medalink claimed the cash prize for the creation, almost $100, $25 of which donated by myself, and many of the other Laravel team. Well done Medalink!

If you would like to use the Blade language syntax highlighting, simply <a title="Medalink Blade TM Support" href="https://github.com/Medalink/Laravel-Blade" target="_blank">head over to Medalink's Github repo</a>.

Thanks Eric!
