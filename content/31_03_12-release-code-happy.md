My Laravel eBook 'Code Happy' <a title="Code Happy at LeanPub" href="http://leanpub.com/codehappy" target="_blank">is now available for purchase from Leanpub.com</a>!

---more---

It currently has the 15 topics covered on the blog, with many, many more coming soon, you pay once and you receive every update, forever! I will try to keep the book up to date with future versions of Laravel, so you can't get a better deal than that!

Please note that this is a publish in progress title, extra tutorials will be added every couple of days to extend the length of the book. Not bad for $4.99 right?

The pricing scheme is a little special, <strong>the base price for the book is set at $4.99</strong>, however the suggested price is set to £39.99. <strong>The suggested price is NOT suggested</strong>, that is simply the label that the site uses, here is how extra payment works..

<strong>If you pay over $4.99</strong>, you well get my everlasting gratitude, and spur me on to continue writing my tutorials at the highest quality I can provide.

<strong>If you pay over $9.99</strong> I will print your name at the end of the next published chapter of the book, the amount you pay over $9.99 decides how 'high-up' it will appear! (fun right!)

<strong>If you pay over $19.99</strong> you can email me / comment a 140 character message to be included with your name in the next published chapter of the book, please keep it clean!

The limit has been set to $39.99 to stop people with more money than sense from emptying their wallets!

&nbsp;

<em><strong>If you spend over $9.99 please send an email to me@daylerees.com with your name, and your purchase ID to be included in the next chapter, if you spend over £19.99 please include your 140 character message in this email.</strong></em>

&nbsp;

The publisher will only accept PayPal payments at present, I will try to find additional publishers to widen the payment options at a later date.

Click the picture of the red panda to buy the book! Thanks!
